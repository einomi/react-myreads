# React MyReads

This is Udacity training project. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is used for bootstraping.

## Installation
To install project, run the following:
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Running
To run application, enter:
### `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
